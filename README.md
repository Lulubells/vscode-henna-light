</p>
<p>Henna is a colour theme for Visual Studio Code. It's utilizing the new theme standard that allows workbench colouring and it's not relying on the outdated Textmate theme format.</p>

<p>Each colour is selected carefully to help legibility (with dyslexics like myself in mind).</p>

<p>Download the theme on the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=httpsterio.henna">VSCode Extension marketplace</a> or <a href="https://github.com/httpsterio/vscode-henna">fork it on GitHub</a></p>

<p>Recommended font is <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">Fira Code</a> with <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/VS-Code-Instructions">font ligatures</a>.</p>
